# Random Generation Widget

## Overview:

A widget to be embedded in this website that can randomly generate a project from the list of current projects, or a task from the current set of to do's for a project. Ensures I will always have a direction if I don't know what to work on.

## Features:

- Takes in data from the website
- Homepage version and project specific version
- Uses a random number generator to select a bullet point
- Either holds amount of bullet points as a variable or runs through the list multiple times 

## Planner To-Do's:
- [ ] Figure out what it looks like (Wheel? Just a button that generates text? Slot machine?)
