- joined the whiteboards and wine this week, worked on a few code challenges!
- poked at a few tutorials for items in unity, discovered that I'll probably have to do my own or keep looking


### Items plan for house haunt:
1. raycast out from mouse
2. if raycast hits an interactable object, display UI telling you what keyboard button to hit to interact ('e to pickup', 's to save', etc.)
3. if raycast is on object and corresponding button is picked, run an interact script
4. interact script does different things depending on what kind of item is being seen (switch case?)

### To-Do 5/20:
1. accessibility conference 9am
2. code challenges 12-1
3. work on item implementation 1-3
