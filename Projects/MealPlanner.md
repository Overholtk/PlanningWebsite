# Meal Planning App:

## Planning/Notes

- [Wireframes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dUCwni8pMWZX6PhatPN7eiJCwMcbcOT6/view?usp=sharing)
- Update wireframes? Feels a little clunky now that I'm looking at it a second time
- Is it necessary to have secure authentication, or is it enough to collect a nickname for the user?
  - Research how much data I can collect before it's considered "medical data" and needs to be protected
